# Spatial profiling of chromatin accessibility via DBIT-seq

</div> 

Deterministic Barcoding in Tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) uncovers spatial biology by combining microfluidics and next- generation sequencing (NGS). Applications of the platform have been published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05094-1), [Nature Biotech](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01676-0), [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7216), and [Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31390-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420313908%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).

This repository contains the  scripts necessary to analyze data from ATAC DBIT-seq experiments performed with the barcoding scheme from [Zhang et al. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05795-1#MOESM1) (barcodes on read2).

# Workflow

**preprocessing** contains a scATAC-seq analysis pipeline built using [snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home); raw fastq files are uploaded directly to this directory for processing.  The pipeline is composed following steps,

- reads are filtered on the correctness of ligation linker sequences;
- read2 is split into two read files ('new' read2, read3);
- alignment is performed with Cell Ranger ATAC;

Cell Ranger ATAC outputs fragment files that are used for downstream analysis.

> Due to the [system requirements](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/overview/system-requirements) of Cell Ranger ATAC, the pipeline must be run in a Linux environment with at least 64GB RAM, an 8-core Intel or AMD processor, and 1TB of free disk space; we recommend running this pipeline in an AWS EC2 instance.

<br>

**analysis** contains R scripts and vignettes for further analysis of ATAC DBIT-seq experiments.  The scripts use the [ArchR](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00790-6) package for dimensionality reduction, clustering, peak calling, and differential accessibility analysis and [Seurat](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00583-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867421005833%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) for incorporation of spatial data.

> The **analysis** scripts require the 'spatial' folder generated by the [AtlasXBrowser](https://github.com/atlasxomics/AtlasXbrowser) package; see AtlasXomics [docs](https://docs.atlasxomics.com) for more information.
