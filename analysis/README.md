### analysis
  The data visualization were implemented with ArchR v1.0.1 and Seurat v3.2 package (Data_visualization folder).
  
  Brief descriptions of analysis scripts:
  
  **metadata_files_for_Seurat_spatial.ipynb**: Generate metadata files that were compatible with Seurat workflow for spatial datasets.
  
  **archR.R**: Data normalization and dimensionality reduction, identifying the marker genes, peak calling, deviatons enrichment anaylsis, bulk sample projection, and pseudotime analysis.
  
  **spatial_data_visualization.R**: Visualize spatially resolved data on tissue sections.
  
  **GO_enrichment_analysis.R**: GO enrichment analysis for marker genes.
  
  **integrative_data_analysis.R**: Integrative data analysis with scRNA-seq reference datasets.
